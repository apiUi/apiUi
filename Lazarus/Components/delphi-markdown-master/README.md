# delphi-markdown

Markdown Processor for Pascal (Delphi/FPC)

## Basic Information

This is a Pascal library that processes to markdown to HTML.
At present the following dialects of markdown are supported:

* The Daring Fireball dialect (see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (translated from https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark)
* The CommonMark Specification (see https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28) (not quite complete. Stil to do: link references)
* Github Flavored Markdown

## Using the Library

Create a TMarkdownProcessor (MarkdownProcessor.pas) of the dialect you want:

     var
       md : TMarkdownProcessor;
       html : string;
     begin
       md := TMarkdownProcessor.createDialect(mdDaringFireball)
  
Decide whether you want to allow active content (not supported for CommonMark)

       md.UnSafe := true;
  
Note: you should only set this to true if you *need* to - active content can be a signficant safety/security issue.  
 
Generate HTML from the Markdown content:

       html := md.process(markdown); 
  
Note that the HTML returned is an HTML fragment, not a full HTML page.

## Testing

Internally, the library includes a comprehensive set of unit tests. For CommonMark,
the tests are those provided as part of the CommonMark spec.

## Delphi 

Versions Supported:

* Any unicode version of Delphi

To use the code:

* clone the repository, and use the units in \source 

To run the tests:
* Test Program is markdown\delphi\MarkDownTests.dproj
* you also need FastMM4, and DUnitX (and update the search paths)
* you'll have to update the run parameters to set the current directory to the root directory for your clones of the reop
* if you don't have TestInsight installed (you very much should!) you'll have to remove the TESTINSIGHT define in the project options

## FPC

Versions Supported:

* tested with FPC 3.2.0+ (but no particular reason it shouldn't work with earlier versions)
* tested with win32, win64, linux64, OSX (but no reason it shouldn't work on other platforms)

To use the code:

* clone the repository, and compile the MarkdownEngine package in source
* alternatively, you can use the units in \source directly

To run the tests:

* Test Program is markdown/fpc/MarkdownTestProgram.lpi
* you need to provide command line parameter -mdRoot [x] where [x] is the location of the repo on your local drive
* depends on https://github.com/grahamegrieve/lazarus-ide-tester
