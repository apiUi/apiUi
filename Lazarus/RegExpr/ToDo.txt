     To do
---------------------------------------------------------------

-=- VCL-version of TRegExpr - for dummies ;) and TRegExprEdit
 (replacement for TMaskEdit).

-=- working with pascal-style string.
 Now pascal-strings converted into PChar, so
 you can't find r.e. in strings with #0 -chars.
 (suggested by Pavel O).

-=- put precalculated lengths into EXACTLY[CI] !

-=- fInputString as string (suggested by Ralf Junker)

-=- Add regstart optimization for case-insensitive mode ?
 Or complitely remove because FirstCharSet is faster ?

-=- "Russian Ranges" --> National ranges (use property WordChars ?
 for ordering letters in ranges by its order in WirdsChars if modifier /r is On)

-=- FirstCharSet as array [#0 .. #255] of REChar ?
 (2x faster then set of REChar)

-=- p-code optimization (remove BRANCH-to-EEND, COMMENT, BACK(?)
 merge EXACTLY etc).

-=- There are no special command for files (Johan Smit).
