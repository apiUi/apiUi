## General Information
apiUi is free software to virtualize and test SOAP and REST api services. It works with HTTP(s) but also with STOMP which means it can also be used with JMS and KAFKA. It is the only free API virtualization tool that uses formal contracts like Swagger, OpenApi and Cobol Copy Books to present a GUI with a form to edit the entire message.

The product comes with two executables, namely apiUi and apiUiServer. The difference between these executables is that apiUi has a graphical user interface (GUI) and apiUiServer has a command line interface (CLI).

It is built using [Lazarus][Lazarus], an open-source, cross-platform IDE for Free Pascal.

Please see the [Documentation][apiUi] for a full description and user guide.
